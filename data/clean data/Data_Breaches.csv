According to its Web site, TJX is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide.Note on our total: included in this breach are 45,700,000 credit and debit card account numbers; 455,000 merchandise return records containing customer names and driver's license numbers; recovery of about 200,000 stolen credit card account numbers; records then 1indicated an additional 48 million people have been affected.

UPDATE (04/26/2007): Three states' banking associations (MA, CT, and ME) filed a class action lawsuit against TJX to recover the costs of damages totaling tens of millions of dollars incurred for replacing customers' debit and credit cards.

This is the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. An indictment was returned on Aug. 5, 2008. Conspirators obtained the credit and debit card numbers by wardriving and hacking into the wireless computer networks of major retailers -- including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW. The indictments are the result of a three-year undercover investigation conducted out of the San Diego Field Office of the U.S. Secret Service. UPDATE (8/30/2008): TrustCo BankCorp NY sued TJX in August 2008 to recoup costs it incurred from reissuing an estimated 4,000 customer MasterCard debit cards after hackers accessed the TJX computer network. The bank stated its cost for the breach was up to $20 per affected account, explaining that it suffered losses from administrative expenses and lost interest and transaction fees. Later in the month, TJX in turn claimed that Trustco failed to implement policies or procedures that would have enabled the bank to avoid canceling and replacing customer debit cards.

As part of the settlement with AmeriFirst Bank, Trustco Bank, HarborOne Credit Union and SELCO Community Credit Union, the Framingham, Mass.-based retailer paid $525,000. The money primarily will be used to cover the banks' expenses in pursuing the legal action.UPDATE (12/15/2009):A Miami hacker who had already pleaded guilty to computer fraud and identity theft for breaches at retailers T.J. Maxx, OfficeMax, and many other merchants, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to similar charges related to breaches at Heartland Payment Systems, 7-11, Hannaford Brothers supermarkets, and two other companies. Albert Gonzalez, 28, reiterated terms of a plea agreement in U.S. District Court in Boston. A week earlier, co-conspirator Stephen Watt of New York, appeared in that same court and was ordered to serve two years in prison and pay $171.5 million in restitution for developing a sniffing program used to grab payment card data in the breach at the TJX companies between 2003 and 2008. UPDATE (3/17/2010): Humza Zaman, a co-conspirator in the hack of TJX and other companies, was sentenced in Boston to 46 months in prison and fined $75,000 for his role in the conspiracy. The sentence matches what prosecutors were seeking. Zaman was charged with laundering between $600,000 and $800,000 for hacker Albert Gonzalez, who is currently awaiting sentencing on charges that he and others hacked into TJX, Office Max, Heartland Payment Systems and numerous other companies to steal data on more than 100 million credit and debit card accounts. Zaman pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy. His sentence includes three years of supervised release with the condition that Zaman must disclose his conviction to any future employer. Upon release, Zaman will not be barred from using computers. Zaman is the second conspirator in the TJX case to be charged. Former Morgan Stanley coder, Stephen Watt, was sentenced in December to two years in prison for his role in the TJX case, which involved supplying Gonzalez with a sniffer program used to siphon card data from the TJX network. UPDATE (3/29/2010): A 28-year-old college dropout who became the world’s biggest credit card hacker on Thursday was sentenced to 20 years in prison for stealing millions of credit union and bank account records from TJX Cos., BJ’s Wholesale Club, Office Max, Dave & Busters, Barnes & Noble and a string of other companies – even as he was working as a $75,000-a-year undercover informant for the U.S. government in identity theft cases. But that’s not the end of it, as Albert Gonzalez is scheduled to be sentenced again to additional years behind bars for additional data thefts at Heartland Payment Systems, Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and 7-Eleven convenience stores. The theft of credit card data cost financial institutions, insurers and cardholders an estimated $200 million, according to law enforcement. JC Penney and Wet Seal were both officially added to the list of retail victims of Albert Gonzalez on Friday (March 26) when U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock refused to continue their cloak of secrecy and removed the seal from their names. StorefrontBacktalk had reported last August that $17 billion JC Penney chain was one of Gonzalez.s victims, even though JC Penney's media representatives were denying it. But the $561 million chain Wet Seal, which has 504 stores in 47 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, had kept their identity secret. No more and that.s the way Woodlock wanted it. UPDATE (4/16/2010): Damon Patrick Toey, the 'trusted subordinate' of TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced in Boston to 5 more years in prison. He also received a $100,000 fine and three years. supervised release, according to the Justice Department.UPDATE (7/8/2010): TJX has settled another lawsuit.  The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, a shareholder of TJX stock, settled with TJX for $595,000 in legal fees and enhanced oversight of customer files.UPDATE (4/8/2011): Albert Gonzalez is appealing his conviction for his role in a
large data breach by claiming that his actions were authorized by the Secret
Service.  The government acknowledged that Gonzalez was a key undercover Secret Service informant at the time of the breaches.  In a 25-page petition, Gonzalez faulted one of his attorney's for failing to prepare a ""Public Authority"" defense, which would have argued that he committed crimes with the approval of government authorities.",Dataloss DB

At Dave & Buster's Islandia, New York, location, the hackers accessed details of about 5,000 payment cards.

The consent decree puts companies on notice that they may face FTC scrutiny and penalties if they fail to use data loss prevention software.UPDATE (07/19/2012): A member of the hacking ring was sentenced to seven years in prison.  Around 80,000 payment card numbers were taken from the 11 Dave & Buster's locations.  It appears that the hacker was part of a larger conspiracy that last between 2005 and 2008 and affected Hannaford Bros. grocery chain, Heartland Payment Systems, TJX retail chain, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, 7-Eleven, JCPenney, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, and Forever 21.

This incident may be the result of a global cyberfraud operation. UPDATE (01/26/2009): Heartland Payment Systems has been sued. The lawsuit seeks damages and relief for the inexplicable delay, questionable timing, and inaccuracies concerning the disclosures with regard to the data breach, which is believed to be the largest in U.S. history. UPDATE (02/12/2009): According to BankInfoSecurity.com, the number of financial institutions that have come forward to say they have been contacted by their credit card companies Visa and MasterCard in relation to the breach has jumped from fewer than 50 to more than 200. UPDATE (06/04/2009): While it's hard to get a handle on just how many consumers were affected by the Heartland Payment Systems (HPY) data breach, the total number of institutions now reporting card compromises is at 656. UPDATE (06/16/2009): Heartland lawsuits to be heard in Texas. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in Louisville, KY issued its decision to consolidate the class action suits. The lawsuits will be heard in the Southern District Court of Texas in Houston. Thirty-one separate lawsuits, on behalf of consumers, investors, banks and credit unions, have been filed against Princeton,N.J.-based Heartland. UPDATE (07/06/2009): Heartland Payment Systems successfully completed the first phase of an end-to-end encryption pilot project designed to enhance its security. UPDATE (08/20/2009): Albert Segvec Gonzalez has been indicted by a federal grand jury in New Jersey - along with two unnamed Russian conspirators - on charges of hacking into Heartland Payment Systems, the New Jersey-based card processing company, as well as Hannaford Brothers, 7-Eleven and two unnamed national retailers, according to the indictment unsealed Monday. Gonzalez, a former Secret Service informant, is already awaiting trial over his involvement in the TJX hack.Total records breached: 100 million transactions per month. It is unclear how many account numbers have been compromised, and how many are represented by multiple transactions. The number of records breached is an estimate, subject to revision. UPDATE (08/20/2009): According to the court document, hackers stole more than 130 million credit and debit card numbers from Heartland and Hannaford combined.UPDATE (05/12/2010): The costs to Heartland Payment Systems Inc. from the massive data breach that it disclosed in January 2009 appear to be steadily adding up. Quarterly financial results released by Heartland last week show that the card payment processor has accrued $139.4 million in breach-related expenses. The figure includes a settlement totaling nearly $60 million with Visa, another of about $3.5 million with American Express and more than $26 million in legal fees. That total also includes $42.8 million that Heartland has set aside to fund proposed settlements with several other litigants over the breach. One example of what the fund is set up for is Heartland's offer to settle several consumer class action lawsuits against it for four million. So far, Heartland has recovered about $30 million from insurance companies.UPDATE (06/02/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has made a third settlement deal, this time with MasterCard, related to a massive data breach two years ago at the card payments processor. As part of the deal, Heartland has agreed to pay as much as US$41.1 million to MasterCard issuers that lost money as a result of the data breach. The deal is contingent on financial institutions representing 80 percent of the affected MasterCard accounts accepting the offer by June 25. MasterCard is recommending that issuers accept the offer.UPDATE (09/01/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has agreed to settle with Discover for five million dollars.  Discover will use the money to cover costs of fraud incidents and reissuing cards.UPDATE (09/19/2010): Jerome Abaquin Gonzales is expected to surrender to police and serve jail time for participating in a credit card forgery ring which used information from the Heartland breach.  The information came from the 4.2 million Discover credit card customers who used their cards at Hannaford Brothers.UPDATE (09/22/2010): Thomas Michio Taniguchi was sentenced to prison for his role in the forgery ring in which Jerome Abaquin Gonzales also participated.UPDATE (12/07/2011): Heartland legal representatives were able to successfully argue that most of the claims against Heartland that were filed by nine banks should be dismissed. All but one claim was dismissed.UPDATE (02/12/2012): The nine banks may have had their claims against Heartland dismissed because Heartland reported that sharing a contractual relationship with the banks defeats their appeal. However, the credit-card-issuing banks are arguing that a New Jersey economic loss rule only bars claims for foreseeable economic losses when the parties are in a contractual relationship and does not bar their negligence claim against Heartland.UPDATE (07/25/2013): Five more foreign hackers were charged for their role in stealing information from Heartland Payment Systems, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, JetBlue, and J.C.

But in an update late Monday, DocuSign confirmed that this malicious third party was able to send the messages to customers and users because it had broken in and stolen DocuSign’s list of customers and users.“As part of our ongoing investigation, today we confirmed that a malicious third party had gained temporary access to a separate, non-core system that allows us to communicate service-related announcements to users via email,” DocuSign wrote in an alert posted to its site. “A complete forensic analysis has confirmed that only email addresses were accessed; no names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, credit card data or other information was accessed.

When in doubt, access your documents directly by visiting docusign.com, and entering the unique security code included at the bottom of every legitimate DocuSign email.

3210,4349.0,MolinaHealthcare.com,2017,2017,,0,MED,,Long Beach,California,"""Earlier this month, KrebsOnSecurity featured a story about a basic security flaw in the Web site of medical diagnostics firm True Health Group that let anyone who was logged in to the site view all other patient records. In that story I mentioned True Health was one of three major healthcare providers with similar website problems, and that the other two providers didn’t even require a login to view all patient records. Today we’ll examine a flaw that was just fixed by Molina Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company that until recently was exposing countless patient medical claims to the entire Internet without requiring any authentication.In April 2017 I received an anonymous tip from a reader who said he’d figured out that just by changing a single number in the Web address when accessing his recent medical claim at MolinaHealthcare.com he could then view any and all other patient claims.More alarmingly, the link he was given to access his claim with Molina was accessible to anyone who had the link; no authentication was required to view it. Nor was any authentication required to view any other records that could be accessed by fiddling with the numbers after the bit at the end of Molinahealthcare.com address (e.g., claimID=123456789).In other words, having access to a single hyperlink to a patient record would allow an attacker to enumerate and download all other claims. The source showed me screenshots of his medical records at Molina, and how when he changed a single number in the URL it happily displayed another patient’s records.The records did not appear to include Social Security numbers, but they do include patient names, addresses and dates of birth, as well as potentially sensitive information that may point to specific diseases, such as medical procedure codes and any prescribed medications.I contacted Molina about the issue, and the company released a brief statement saying it had fixed the problem. Molina also said it was trying to figure out how such a mistake was made, and if there was any evidence to suggest the Web site bug had been widely abused.“The previously identified security issue has been remediated,” the company said. “Because protecting our members’ information is of utmost importance to Molina and out of an abundance of caution, we are taking our ePortal temporarily offline to perform additional testing of our system security.

The hacker, who uses the handle “thedarkoverlord,” published the premiere episode from the upcoming season of “Orange Is the New Black” on Friday to the Pirate Bay.Netflix has set June 9 for the release of season five of “Orange Is the New Black.” It’s possible that the streamer will move up the “OITNB” premiere date now that the bulk of the episodes have leaked.Reps for Netflix did not respond to a request for comment about the latest developmentAccording to “thedarkoverlord,” the hacker or hackers also have obtained unreleased shows from ABC, Fox, National Geographic and IFC. The content appears to have been stolen in an attack on post-production studio Larson Studios in late 2016, according to piracy-news site TorrentFreak. “Thedarkoverlord” explained in an online post that they obtained only the first 10 of the 13 episodes of “OITNB” season 5 because the cyberattack was carried out before the final three installments were available.In a statement Friday, Netflix said: “We are aware of the situation. A production vendor used by several major TV studios had its security compromised and the appropriate law enforcement authorities are involved.”It’s not clear what impact the theft and piracy of one of Netflix’s top shows will have. The hacker (or hacker collective) behind the heist has claimed to have made an extortion demand to the company, asking for an unspecified sum of money. However, the motive for purloining and leaking “OITNB” could be more about bragging rights in the cybercrime underworld.""",Maryland Attorney General

Sony placed an outage to block users from playing online games or accessing services like Netflix and Hulu Plus on Friday April 22. Sony says the outage will continue until the situation is addressed, which will likely be within the next week. Sony believes an unauthorized person has obtained names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, PlayStation Network/Qriocity password and login, and handle/PSN online IDs for multiple users. The attacker may have also stolen users' purchase history, billing address, and password security questions. User credit card numbers may have also been obtained. Sony has hired a security firm to investigate the incident and strengthen the network infrastructure by re-building their system to provide greater protection of personal information.An individual filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all PSN users following seven days of a Sony PlayStation Network outage.  The lawsuit alleges that Sony ""failed to encrypt data and establish adequate firewalls to handle a server intrusion contingency, failed to provide prompt and adequate warnings of security breaches, and unreasonably delayed in bringing the PSN service back on line.""  It also accused Sony of violating the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standard, which prohibits companies from storing cardholder data.UPDATE (5/3/2011): A review of Sony's network breach revealed that it was larger than first thought. Sony turned the SOE system off.  Hackers may have taken personal information from an additional 24,600,000 user accounts in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Names, addresses, genders, email addresses, login name and associated password, phone numbers and birth dates of SOE gaming customers, as well as data from about 12,700 credit card accounts and 10,700 bank accounts from an outdated 2007 database could have been accessed.  The outdated account information that may have been obtained by hackers includes credit card numbers, debit card numbers, expiration dates, bank account numbers, customer names, account names and customer addresses. The SOE network hosts games that are played over the Internet on personal computers and is separate from the PlayStation network.  Sony has not clearly indicated if credit card numbers were compromised.  At least one report indicates that the numbers were encrypted.  These breached records will not be added to the total until more is known.UPDATE (5/6/2011): Sony now indicates that some credit card numbers were compromised.  Twelve million credit card numbers were unencrypted and could easily be read.UPDATE (5/7/2011): Sony discovered that hackers had placed customer information online. Sony removed the information.  It included customer names and addresses from a 2001 Sony database.Service restoration for the PlayStation network was indefinitely delayed. Additionally, the CEO issued an apology letter.UPDATE (5/17/2011): Hackers began changing user passwords by using PSN account emails and dates of birth within two days of the partial restoration of the PlayStation Network.  Sony failed to alter the password reset system to account for hackers having obtained user email addresses and dates of birth.  Users who changed their passwords, but not the email associated with their PlayStation Network accounts, were vulnerable to the hacker exploit. Sony shut down the PlayStation Network again and released a short statement about the incident.UPDATE (5/23/2011): Sony headquarters expects to spend about $171 million on its personal information theft protection program, welcome back programs, customer support, network security enhancements and legal costs associated with the breach.UPDATE (6/2/2011): Sony fully restored all Playstation Network services in all areas except Japan.  The Playstation Store and Qriocity divisions are now functioning properly.  UPDATE (6/4/2011): A concise history of the Sony hacks can be found here.UPDATE (7/21/2011): Zurich American, one of Sony's insurers, is suing to deny releasing data breach coverage funds to Sony.  Sony expects the breach to lower operating profit by $178 million in the current financial year.  A total of 55 class action complaints have been filed.UPDATE (10/11/2011): Sony Online Entertainment became aware of a large number of unauthorized sign-in attempts.  The attempts took place between October 7 and 10.  About 93,000 PlayStation Network, Sony Entertainment Network, and Sony Online Entertainment services accounts may have been compromised.  The unauthorized parties appear to have verified valid sign-in IDs and passwords after a number of failed attempts.  Sony temporarily locked those accounts. It is unclear if the email addresses were obtained from a previous breach.UPDATE (10/19/2012): A federal judge found that Sony users signed a privacy policy informing them that Sony's security was not perfect.  Sony was cleared of negligence, unjust enrichment, bailment, and violations of California consumer protection statutes. The judge ruled that plaintiffs could not claim that Sony violated consumer-protection laws because PSN services were free of cost.  This dismissed much of the lawsuit.UPDATE (12/16/2013): Sony agreed to drop an insurance claim over litigation related to the 2011 breach.UPDATE (7/30/2014): ""Sony recently offered to settle a class action lawsuit over the 2011 breach of its PlayStation Network.

During this process, attackers were able to discover a security flaw and gained access to the system.BFS contains the information of about 50 percent of current students and 65 percent of active employees. Affected individuals largely include students, faculty and staff who received payments from the campus, mainly through electronic fund transfers. Those who received paper payments, however, may have also been affected.A private computer investigation firm was retained by the campus to further determine whether personal information was compromised. The campus will send notice letters in the mail with more information about free credit monitoring and insurance to those who were potentially impacted starting Friday.According to Rivers, this is the third significant breach UC Berkeley has seen in the past five years.Within a day of the unauthorized intrusion Dec. 28, the campus’s security team had detected and began efforts to contain the attack, according to campus spokesperson Janet Gilmore.Once campus IT staff identified the unauthorized access, they forensically preserved copies of the system for investigation purposes and took affected servers offline for about two weeks to prevent further access.

BlackHeart Records is an Independent label founded by Joan Jett and Kenny Laguna and has a good reputation as an established label with a range of well known artists.The data breach is a massive treasure trove for fans and cyber criminals alike. There are unreleased tracks, never before seen pictures, even rejection letters from 1980 when Joan Jett was trying to get a record deal. There are also social security numbers of label employees and band members, internal memos and scanned checks of royalty payments and much more.From the entertaining obsessed fan emails to lawsuits and arrest records of the label manager, this database is a look inside of how the record label is operated and the communication between rock and roll royalty.Although there are no naked pictures or Hollywood style tabloid drama in the hundreds of gigabytes and countless thousands of files, there is a complete view of the many aspects of being a famous rockstar, operating a record label, and the meticulous documentation of every achievement, failure, or internal and external communications.With the social security numbers, banking information, scans of passports, and IDs it is easy to see that cyber criminals could have exploited this data for identify theft, fraud, or extortion.

The site's security team investigated the matter as soon as it became aware of the incident.
“Our analysis gives us no reason to believe that this information was used to access Tumblr accounts,” the blog said.

Security researcher and Haveibeenpwned

 information for sale on a dark web market site and listed the breach on
 his own site as the third largest ever.
A hacker known as Peace was selling the database for $150, according to Vice's Motherboard.
 Peace told Motherboard the price is so low because the salted passwords
 are very difficult to crack however, Hunt told the publication roughly 
half of the passwords will likely be cracked due to weak password 
protections that were used at the time. 
On May 12, Tumblr notified
 users of the breach that compromised user email addresses with salted 
and hashed passwords from early 2013 and told users there is no reason 
to believe that the information was used to access their Tumblr 
accounts.
Although the breach isn't as bad as other major breaches, it has the 
potential to be dangerous for users who re-use passwords, Kaspersky Lab 
Senior Security Researcher Brian Bartholomew told SCMagazine.com via 
email. 
“If you were to think about how many users from Tumblr have Apple 
cloud accounts, Twitter accounts, Gmail or other online mail accounts, 
etc. the potential risk is high for this breach to bleed over into other

4122,5495.0,LinkedIn,2016,2016,,"117,000,000",BSO,,Mountain View,California,"""A recent incident involving LinkedIn, the business-oriented social 
networking service, is showing that data breaches can cause big problems
 for companies and consumers — even years after the breaches take place.
 On May 17, 2016, LinkedIn discovered that information stolen in a 2012 
incident was being made available online, and notified site users immediately the next day about what happened and what they were doing to fix it.
In 2012, an alleged 117 million
 email and password combinations were stolen by hackers. At the time, 
LinkedIn issued a mandatory password reset for any accounts they thought
 were compromised; all LinkedIn members were encouraged to change their 
passwords as well, just in case.
Fast forward to present day, and the 2012 breach has come back to 
haunt LinkedIn. The stolen data popped up online, and in an e-mail to 
LinkedIn users sent on May 25, 2016, the company said the published 
information included email addresses, hashed passwords, and LinkedIn 
member IDs, which are an internal identifier LinkedIn assigns to each 
member profile. They immediately invalidated passwords of all LinkedIn 
accounts that were created prior to the 2012 breach and had not 
undergone a password reset since the breach.
LinkedIn’s attempts to protect users, however, are extending beyond 
resetting passwords this time. They are also using automated tools to 
try and identify (and block) any suspicious activity on specific 
LinkedIn accounts. The proper authorities have been contacted and 
LinkedIn is working with law enforcement. They have demanded that anyone
 making stolen password data available must stop immediately, or face 
potential legal action.
In their e-mail, the company also shared that they have improved 
security features since the 2012 breach, which will hopefully prevent 
another incident like this from happening in the future. As examples, 
they noted that they use salted hashes to store passwords and offer two-step verification
 for members who are interested in additional security. LinkedIn also 
encouraged members to use strong passwords and to change them regularly.
 If you don’t change your password often enough because you have trouble
 remembering new passwords, consider using a password manager, which can help you keep all of your passwords organized.""More information: https://www.identityforce.com/blog/linkedin-data-breach-continues-cause-...",Media

Of those emails sent externally, 20 were sent to six IRS employees’ personal email accounts. The significance of where the emails were sent is relevant to the level of the security risk to the taxpayer data. The report noted that unencrypted emails sent within the IRS internal network were of lower risk because they remained behind the agency’s firewalls which greatly lowers the probability they could be accessed by a third party. However, the emails sent outside of the agency were exposed to greater risk, not only because they were not encrypted, but because they no longer had the protection afforded by the firewall. Additionally, for the emails sent to personal accounts, the report noted that per IRS policy, no officer or employee of the IRS may use a personal email account to conduct official business. 326 emails containing 8,031 different taxpayers’ data may not sound like much, but TIGTA had this to say about their findings"" - See more at: http://www.fedsmith.com/2016/11/20/ig-irs-employees-sent-unencrypted-ema...More information: http://www.fedsmith.com/2016/11/20/ig-irs-employees-sent-unencrypted-ema...",Media

No mention has been made of when the incident was discovered.This is the third such incident of this nature to have affected the NC Department of Health and Human Services in the past 38 months.On December 30, 2013, 49,000 Medicaid cards of minors were accidentally mailed to incorrect recipients, exposing Medicaid numbers, names and birth dates. The privacy breach was attributed to human error. Two years later, 1,615 patients were impacted when an unencrypted email containing was sent to the Granville County Health Department. The email contained a spreadsheet containing names, Medicaid ID numbers, provider’s name and ID number, and other Medicaid related information.The two email incidents are not believed to have resulted in any individual’s data being compromised. No indications that the emails were intercepted has been found by the NC Department of Health and Human Services, although the possibility cannot be ruled out. Individuals affected by the latest incident have been advised to monitor their accounts for any signs of fraud as a precaution.In order to prevent similar security breaches from occurring in the future, policies and procedures have now been changed. Rather than emailing Medicaid numbers and names, identification numbers will be used in future.

Access to ePHI was gained via a third-party vendor system used by Brand New Day’s contracting provider six days previously on December 22, 2016.The breach notification submitted to the California attorney general does not indicate whether the ePHI of plan members was stolen, although the data were accessed and a criminal investigation into the breach has been launched by law enforcement. The types of data accessed include plan members’ names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and Medicare ID numbers.Upon discovery of the incident, Brand New Day immediately launched an investigation and contacted its vendor to ensure that access to ePHI was immediately terminated. The vendor was informed that someone had improperly accessed plan members’ data and rapid action was taken to block access. Brand New Day says the error that allowed ePHI to be accessed was eliminated ‘within hours’ of its vendor being notified of the breach.While no specific mention of the exact nature of improper access was made, Brand New Day says “We changed our practices regarding access requiring monthly verification of each user.” Brand New Day is also performing a thorough ‘self audit’ to determine whether any other errors have occurred that jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity and availability of ePHI.As a precaution against identity theft, all affected individuals have been offered 12 months’ complimentary identity theft mitigation services via Experian.The breach report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights indicates 14,005 individuals were impacted by the incident.

The database, about 52 gigabytes in size, contains just under 33.7 million unique email addresses and other contact information from employees of thousands of companies, representing a large portion of the US corporate population. 	 	 	 	 	Dun & Bradstreet, a business services giant, confirmed that it owns the database, which it acquired as part  	of a 2015 deal to buy NetProspex for $125 million.The purchased database contains dozens of fields, some including personal information such as names, job titles and functions, work email addresses, and phone numbers. 	 	 	 	 	Other information includes more generic corporate and publicly sourced data, such as believed office location, the number of employees in the business unit, and other descriptions of the kind of industry the company falls into, such as advertising, legal,  media and broadcasting, and telecoms. 	 	 	 	 	This entire database is used for marketers who want to directly target their own email campaigns and through other communications methods for current and prospective customers. 	 	 	 	 	The data can be bought either in bulk, or by type of record by companies, but it's not known exactly how much the going rate is for a full data set of this size. We understand from  	a 2015 brochure that the cost of accessing a half-million records can cost some firms up to $200,000. 	 	 	 	 	Troy Hunt, who runs breach notification site  	Have I Been Pwned, obtained the database and analyzed the records. 	 	 	 	 	In  	a blog post Tuesday, Hunt said the breakdown was entirely US-focused, with California as the most represented demographic with over four million records, then New York with 2.7 million records and Texas with 2.6 million records. 	 	 	 	 	Hunt's analysis of the records showed that the leading organization by records is the Dept. of Defense, with 101,013 employee records, followed closely by the US Postal Service with 88,153 employee records. 	 	 	 	 	The US Army, Air Force, and Dept. of Veterans Affairs are all listed with a combined 76,379 records. 	 	 	 	 	AT&T, Boeing, Dell, FedEx, IBM, and Xerox were among the most named companies in the database, with tens of thousands of employee records each. 	 	 	 	 	""Whilst you could piece together parts of the data from information already in the public domain, having it aggregated and so easily searchable in this fashion is enormously valuable,"" said Hunt in an email on Tuesday. ""It also serves as a reminder that we've lost control of our privacy; the vast majority of people in the data set would have no idea their information is being sold in this fashion and they certainly don't have any control over it."" 	 	 	 	 	Hunt ran the exposed database through  	Have I Been Pwned's database of breached records, which showed 14 percent of email addresses already existed in his database.
