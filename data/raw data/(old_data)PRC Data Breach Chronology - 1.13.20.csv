This is the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. An indictment was returned on Aug. 5, 2008. Conspirators obtained the credit and debit card numbers by wardriving and hacking into the wireless computer networks of major retailers -- including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW. The indictments are the result of a three-year undercover investigation conducted out of the San Diego Field Office of the U.S. Secret Service. UPDATE (8/30/2008): TrustCo BankCorp NY sued TJX in August 2008 to recoup costs it incurred from reissuing an estimated 4,000 customer MasterCard debit cards after hackers accessed the TJX computer network.

Maxx, OfficeMax, and many other merchants, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to similar charges related to breaches at Heartland Payment Systems, 7-11, Hannaford Brothers supermarkets, and two other companies. Albert Gonzalez, 28, reiterated terms of a plea agreement in U.S. District Court in Boston. A week earlier, co-conspirator Stephen Watt of New York, appeared in that same court and was ordered to serve two years in prison and pay $171.5 million in restitution for developing a sniffing program used to grab payment card data in the breach at the TJX companies between 2003 and 2008. UPDATE (3/17/2010): Humza Zaman, a co-conspirator in the hack of TJX and other companies, was sentenced in Boston to 46 months in prison and fined $75,000 for his role in the conspiracy. The sentence matches what prosecutors were seeking. Zaman was charged with laundering between $600,000 and $800,000 for hacker Albert Gonzalez, who is currently awaiting sentencing on charges that he and others hacked into TJX, Office Max, Heartland Payment Systems and numerous other companies to steal data on more than 100 million credit and debit card accounts. Zaman pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy. His sentence includes three years of supervised release with the condition that Zaman must disclose his conviction to any future employer. Upon release, Zaman will not be barred from using computers. Zaman is the second conspirator in the TJX case to be charged. Former Morgan Stanley coder, Stephen Watt, was sentenced in December to two years in prison for his role in the TJX case, which involved supplying Gonzalez with a sniffer program used to siphon card data from the TJX network. UPDATE (3/29/2010): A 28-year-old college dropout who became the world’s biggest credit card hacker on Thursday was sentenced to 20 years in prison for stealing millions of credit union and bank account records from TJX Cos., BJ’s Wholesale Club, Office Max, Dave & Busters, Barnes & Noble and a string of other companies – even as he was working as a $75,000-a-year undercover informant for the U.S. government in identity theft cases. But that’s not the end of it, as Albert Gonzalez is scheduled to be sentenced again to additional years behind bars for additional data thefts at Heartland Payment Systems, Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and 7-Eleven convenience stores. The theft of credit card data cost financial institutions, insurers and cardholders an estimated $200 million, according to law enforcement. JC Penney and Wet Seal were both officially added to the list of retail victims of Albert Gonzalez on Friday (March 26) when U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock refused to continue their cloak of secrecy and removed the seal from their names. StorefrontBacktalk had reported last August that $17 billion JC Penney chain was one of Gonzalez.s victims, even though JC Penney's media representatives were denying it. But the $561 million chain Wet Seal, which has 504 stores in 47 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, had kept their identity secret. No more and that.s the way Woodlock wanted it. UPDATE (4/16/2010): Damon Patrick Toey, the 'trusted subordinate' of TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced in Boston to 5 more years in prison. He also received a $100,000 fine and three years. supervised release, according to the Justice Department.UPDATE (7/8/2010): TJX has settled another lawsuit.  The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, a shareholder of TJX stock, settled with TJX for $595,000 in legal fees and enhanced oversight of customer files.UPDATE (4/8/2011): Albert Gonzalez is appealing his conviction for his role in a
large data breach by claiming that his actions were authorized by the Secret
Service.  The government acknowledged that Gonzalez was a key undercover Secret Service informant at the time of the breaches.  In a 25-page petition, Gonzalez faulted one of his attorney's for failing to prepare a ""Public Authority"" defense, which would have argued that he committed crimes with the approval of government authorities.",Dataloss DB

This incident may be the result of a global cyberfraud operation. UPDATE (01/26/2009): Heartland Payment Systems has been sued. The lawsuit seeks damages and relief for the inexplicable delay, questionable timing, and inaccuracies concerning the disclosures with regard to the data breach, which is believed to be the largest in U.S. history. UPDATE (02/12/2009): According to BankInfoSecurity.com, the number of financial institutions that have come forward to say they have been contacted by their credit card companies Visa and MasterCard in relation to the breach has jumped from fewer than 50 to more than 200. UPDATE (06/04/2009): While it's hard to get a handle on just how many consumers were affected by the Heartland Payment Systems (HPY) data breach, the total number of institutions now reporting card compromises is at 656. UPDATE (06/16/2009): Heartland lawsuits to be heard in Texas. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in Louisville, KY issued its decision to consolidate the class action suits. The lawsuits will be heard in the Southern District Court of Texas in Houston. Thirty-one separate lawsuits, on behalf of consumers, investors, banks and credit unions, have been filed against Princeton,N.J.-based Heartland. UPDATE (07/06/2009): Heartland Payment Systems successfully completed the first phase of an end-to-end encryption pilot project designed to enhance its security. UPDATE (08/20/2009): Albert Segvec Gonzalez has been indicted by a federal grand jury in New Jersey - along with two unnamed Russian conspirators - on charges of hacking into Heartland Payment Systems, the New Jersey-based card processing company, as well as Hannaford Brothers, 7-Eleven and two unnamed national retailers, according to the indictment unsealed Monday. Gonzalez, a former Secret Service informant, is already awaiting trial over his involvement in the TJX hack.Total records breached: 100 million transactions per month. It is unclear how many account numbers have been compromised, and how many are represented by multiple transactions. The number of records breached is an estimate, subject to revision. UPDATE (08/20/2009): According to the court document, hackers stole more than 130 million credit and debit card numbers from Heartland and Hannaford combined.UPDATE (05/12/2010): The costs to Heartland Payment Systems Inc. from the massive data breach that it disclosed in January 2009 appear to be steadily adding up. Quarterly financial results released by Heartland last week show that the card payment processor has accrued $139.4 million in breach-related expenses. The figure includes a settlement totaling nearly $60 million with Visa, another of about $3.5 million with American Express and more than $26 million in legal fees. That total also includes $42.8 million that Heartland has set aside to fund proposed settlements with several other litigants over the breach. One example of what the fund is set up for is Heartland's offer to settle several consumer class action lawsuits against it for four million. So far, Heartland has recovered about $30 million from insurance companies.UPDATE (06/02/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has made a third settlement deal, this time with MasterCard, related to a massive data breach two years ago at the card payments processor. As part of the deal, Heartland has agreed to pay as much as US$41.1 million to MasterCard issuers that lost money as a result of the data breach. The deal is contingent on financial institutions representing 80 percent of the affected MasterCard accounts accepting the offer by June 25. MasterCard is recommending that issuers accept the offer.UPDATE (09/01/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has agreed to settle with Discover for five million dollars.  Discover will use the money to cover costs of fraud incidents and reissuing cards.UPDATE (09/19/2010): Jerome Abaquin Gonzales is expected to surrender to police and serve jail time for participating in a credit card forgery ring which used information from the Heartland breach.  The information came from the 4.2 million Discover credit card customers who used their cards at Hannaford Brothers.UPDATE (09/22/2010): Thomas Michio Taniguchi was sentenced to prison for his role in the forgery ring in which Jerome Abaquin Gonzales also participated.UPDATE (12/07/2011): Heartland legal representatives were able to successfully argue that most of the claims against Heartland that were filed by nine banks should be dismissed. All but one claim was dismissed.UPDATE (02/12/2012): The nine banks may have had their claims against Heartland dismissed because Heartland reported that sharing a contractual relationship with the banks defeats their appeal. However, the credit-card-issuing banks are arguing that a New Jersey economic loss rule only bars claims for foreseeable economic losses when the parties are in a contractual relationship and does not bar their negligence claim against Heartland.UPDATE (07/25/2013): Five more foreign hackers were charged for their role in stealing information from Heartland Payment Systems, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, JetBlue, and J.C.

3515,2016,Idaho Department of Fish and Game,Boise,Idaho,8/26/2016,GOV,0,"""Idaho Fish and Game today learned that personal information for license buyers who began purchasing hunting and fishing licenses and tags prior to 2008 was potentially accessed by a breach of the online computer license sales system owned and operated by Active Network, a Texas-based company.During a Friday afternoon conference call, Active Network executives told Fish and Game that it cannot confirm whether any personal information was actually taken but that it is possible.The data breach apparently occurred sometime over the summer.  Personal information potentially includes name, age, address, and Social Security Number.  Idaho Fish and Game is required by state law to obtain this information to issue a license. Credit card information is not kept in the Active Network licensing system and Fish and Game is confident it was not accessed.“This is a serious matter and we encourage all license holders who may potentially be affected to take proactive steps to protect themselves,” Fish and Game Deputy Director Ed Schriever said.  “We apologize to our license buyers and will continue to work with Active Network to get to the bottom of this.”More information: https://idfg.idaho.gov/press/idaho-fish-and-game-customer-information-po...",Government Agency

In that story I mentioned True Health was one of three major healthcare providers with similar website problems, and that the other two providers didn’t even require a login to view all patient records. Today we’ll examine a flaw that was just fixed by Molina Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company that until recently was exposing countless patient medical claims to the entire Internet without requiring any authentication.In April 2017 I received an anonymous tip from a reader who said he’d figured out that just by changing a single number in the Web address when accessing his recent medical claim at MolinaHealthcare.com he could then view any and all other patient claims.More alarmingly, the link he was given to access his claim with Molina was accessible to anyone who had the link; no authentication was required to view it. Nor was any authentication required to view any other records that could be accessed by fiddling with the numbers after the bit at the end of Molinahealthcare.com address (e.g., claimID=123456789).In other words, having access to a single hyperlink to a patient record would allow an attacker to enumerate and download all other claims. The source showed me screenshots of his medical records at Molina, and how when he changed a single number in the URL it happily displayed another patient’s records.The records did not appear to include Social Security numbers, but they do include patient names, addresses and dates of birth, as well as potentially sensitive information that may point to specific diseases, such as medical procedure codes and any prescribed medications.I contacted Molina about the issue, and the company released a brief statement saying it had fixed the problem.

The hacker, who uses the handle “thedarkoverlord,” published the premiere episode from the upcoming season of “Orange Is the New Black” on Friday to the Pirate Bay.Netflix has set June 9 for the release of season five of “Orange Is the New Black.” It’s possible that the streamer will move up the “OITNB” premiere date now that the bulk of the episodes have leaked.Reps for Netflix did not respond to a request for comment about the latest developmentAccording to “thedarkoverlord,” the hacker or hackers also have obtained unreleased shows from ABC, Fox, National Geographic and IFC. The content appears to have been stolen in an attack on post-production studio Larson Studios in late 2016, according to piracy-news site TorrentFreak. “Thedarkoverlord” explained in an online post that they obtained only the first 10 of the 13 episodes of “OITNB” season 5 because the cyberattack was carried out before the final three installments were available.In a statement Friday, Netflix said: “We are aware of the situation. A production vendor used by several major TV studios had its security compromised and the appropriate law enforcement authorities are involved.”It’s not clear what impact the theft and piracy of one of Netflix’s top shows will have. The hacker (or hacker collective) behind the heist has claimed to have made an extortion demand to the company, asking for an unspecified sum of money. However, the motive for purloining and leaking “OITNB” could be more about bragging rights in the cybercrime underworld.""",Maryland Attorney General

The center, a research arm of the university, contracts with state agencies to evaluate the quality of the data those agencies are collecting, said Phil Weiler, vice president for marketing and communication at WSU.WSU doesn’t have any idea if the thieves were able to break into the safe, if they know what to do with the hard drive, or if they’re able to interpret the data, which is stored in a relational database that requires some expertise to unravel, Weiler said. In addition, some of the files were encrypted, and some were password protected, he said.But there’s certainly a chance they’ll figure it out, which is why WSU hired a computer-forensics firm to determine what data had been backed up onto the hard drive. This month, WSU sent letters to 1 million people warning them of the breach. The university is offering those affected a year subscription to free credit-monitoring and identity-theft protection.The data includes names and a mix of personal information, including Social Security numbers for some of those affected. Some of it comes from school districts who track their students after graduation to find out if they’re going on to college, or getting jobs, Weiler said. The research center also has contracted with state job-training programs that track their clients to see if they were able to find employment.Weiler said the hard drive contained data from 1998 to 2013.

Sony placed an outage to block users from playing online games or accessing services like Netflix and Hulu Plus on Friday April 22. Sony says the outage will continue until the situation is addressed, which will likely be within the next week. Sony believes an unauthorized person has obtained names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, PlayStation Network/Qriocity password and login, and handle/PSN online IDs for multiple users. The attacker may have also stolen users' purchase history, billing address, and password security questions. User credit card numbers may have also been obtained. Sony has hired a security firm to investigate the incident and strengthen the network infrastructure by re-building their system to provide greater protection of personal information.An individual filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all PSN users following seven days of a Sony PlayStation Network outage.  The lawsuit alleges that Sony ""failed to encrypt data and establish adequate firewalls to handle a server intrusion contingency, failed to provide prompt and adequate warnings of security breaches, and unreasonably delayed in bringing the PSN service back on line.""  It also accused Sony of violating the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standard, which prohibits companies from storing cardholder data.UPDATE (5/3/2011): A review of Sony's network breach revealed that it was larger than first thought. Sony turned the SOE system off.  Hackers may have taken personal information from an additional 24,600,000 user accounts in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.

Acquisitions employee has resulted in the protected health information 
of 659 patients from the Abilene region of Texas being exposed.
In May 2015, Oceans Acquisitions confirmed that all portable devices,
 including laptop computers, had sensitive data encrypted. In the event 
of theft or loss of a device, all PHI stored on that device would be 
protected. The encryption would prevent any unauthorized individual from
 being able to access stored data.
However, the laptop theft occurred on April 9, 2015, a month before 
Oceans Acquisitions ascertained that all devices were protected. While 
the healthcare provider believed the laptop computer theft did not place
 any data at risk of exposure, this has turned out not to be the case.
According to a substitute breach notice issued on February 2, 2016, 
Oceans Acquisitions determined that the laptop in question did contain 
the PHI of 659 individuals, and that those patients potentially had 
their PHI exposed. This came to light during an unrelated systems 
review, which was not linked to the laptop computer theft.
The data were stored in an email account that could be accessed 
through the computer. The data exposed included names of patients, 
medical record numbers, dates of birth, payer information, medical 
diagnoses, and admission dates. No financial information, insurance 
data, or Social Security numbers were stored in the email account or on

When the campus detected a vulnerability in one of these areas in November, the campus began installing and testing a security fix — known as a patch — which can take weeks, Rivers said during the press call. During this process, attackers were able to discover a security flaw and gained access to the system.BFS contains the information of about 50 percent of current students and 65 percent of active employees. Affected individuals largely include students, faculty and staff who received payments from the campus, mainly through electronic fund transfers. Those who received paper payments, however, may have also been affected.A private computer investigation firm was retained by the campus to further determine whether personal information was compromised. The campus will send notice letters in the mail with more information about free credit monitoring and insurance to those who were potentially impacted starting Friday.According to Rivers, this is the third significant breach UC Berkeley has seen in the past five years.Within a day of the unauthorized intrusion Dec. 28, the campus’s security team had detected and began efforts to contain the attack, according to campus spokesperson Janet Gilmore.Once campus IT staff identified the unauthorized access, they forensically preserved copies of the system for investigation purposes and took affected servers offline for about two weeks to prevent further access. When the campus shut down BFS and supporting systems, some students received emails in early January notifying them of possible disruptions to financial aid disbursements.""More information: http://www.dailycal.org/2016/02/26/campus-notifies-nearly-80000-students...",Media

A hacker known as Peace was selling the database for $150, according to Vice's Motherboard.
 Peace told Motherboard the price is so low because the salted passwords

5495,2016,LinkedIn,Mountain View,California,5/17/2016,BSO,"117,000,000","""A recent incident involving LinkedIn, the business-oriented social 
networking service, is showing that data breaches can cause big problems
 for companies and consumers — even years after the breaches take place.
 On May 17, 2016, LinkedIn discovered that information stolen in a 2012 
incident was being made available online, and notified site users immediately the next day about what happened and what they were doing to fix it.
In 2012, an alleged 117 million
 email and password combinations were stolen by hackers. At the time, 
LinkedIn issued a mandatory password reset for any accounts they thought
 were compromised; all LinkedIn members were encouraged to change their 
passwords as well, just in case.
Fast forward to present day, and the 2012 breach has come back to 
haunt LinkedIn. The stolen data popped up online, and in an e-mail to 
LinkedIn users sent on May 25, 2016, the company said the published 
information included email addresses, hashed passwords, and LinkedIn 
member IDs, which are an internal identifier LinkedIn assigns to each 
member profile. They immediately invalidated passwords of all LinkedIn 
accounts that were created prior to the 2012 breach and had not 
undergone a password reset since the breach.
LinkedIn’s attempts to protect users, however, are extending beyond 
resetting passwords this time. They are also using automated tools to 
try and identify (and block) any suspicious activity on specific 
LinkedIn accounts. The proper authorities have been contacted and 
LinkedIn is working with law enforcement. They have demanded that anyone
 making stolen password data available must stop immediately, or face 
potential legal action.
In their e-mail, the company also shared that they have improved 
security features since the 2012 breach, which will hopefully prevent 
another incident like this from happening in the future. As examples, 
they noted that they use salted hashes to store passwords and offer two-step verification
 for members who are interested in additional security. LinkedIn also 
encouraged members to use strong passwords and to change them regularly.
 If you don’t change your password often enough because you have trouble
 remembering new passwords, consider using a password manager, which can help you keep all of your passwords organized.""More information: https://www.identityforce.com/blog/linkedin-data-breach-continues-cause-...",Media

The report noted that unencrypted emails sent within the IRS internal network were of lower risk because they remained behind the agency’s firewalls which greatly lowers the probability they could be accessed by a third party. However, the emails sent outside of the agency were exposed to greater risk, not only because they were not encrypted, but because they no longer had the protection afforded by the firewall.

The leak at PIP printing, which has more than 400 locations in 13 countries, went on for four months before it was repaired Tuesday, cybersecurity experts involved in investigating the breach told NBC News. But there's no evidence that any hackers may have stumbled upon the files to use them for malicious purposes, they add.  The documents, which NBC News examined, ranges from emails revealing credit card and social security numbers to legal filings such as depositions, subpoenas and labor lawsuits. Extensive medical records belonging to high-profile athletes were also at risk.PIP owner Michael Bluestein told NBC News that the breach appeared to stem from a third-party IT firm that accidentally misconfigured the backup protocols — essentially leaving a ""back door"" open in the system.  ""After discovering the breach, we acted quickly to lock down access to our database,"" Bluestein said. ""We immediately strengthened our security controls.

The employees were required to move patients between treatment rooms and hospital floors. The pair were discovered to have first started viewing patients protected health information in May 2015. Medical records of patients continued to be accessed until December 2016.The types of information accessed included patients’ names, medical record IDs, and birth dates. According to a press release from VUMC, one individual was also able to view some patients’ Social Security numbers. While patients’ electronic medical records were accessed, VUMC does not believe that any information has been copied or misused. VUMC has not said why patients’ health information was viewed by the employees, although the individuals concerned have been disciplined for their actions.Patients are not believed to be at any elevated risk of suffering identity theft or fraud as a result of the privacy breaches. However, as a precaution, VUMC said “we are contacting each of them by letter to recommend that they vigilantly review account statements and their credit status.” Any patient whose Social Security number has been viewed is being provided with credit monitoring services via Experian Family Secure “out of an abundance of caution.”In response to the breach, Vanderbilt University Medical Center has changed policies and procedures relating to how patient transporters are provided with patients’ health information.

Dun & Bradstreet, a business services giant, confirmed that it owns the database, which it acquired as part  	of a 2015 deal to buy NetProspex for $125 million.The purchased database contains dozens of fields, some including personal information such as names, job titles and functions, work email addresses, and phone numbers. 	 	 	 	 	Other information includes more generic corporate and publicly sourced data, such as believed office location, the number of employees in the business unit, and other descriptions of the kind of industry the company falls into, such as advertising, legal,  media and broadcasting, and telecoms. 	 	 	 	 	This entire database is used for marketers who want to directly target their own email campaigns and through other communications methods for current and prospective customers. 	 	 	 	 	The data can be bought either in bulk, or by type of record by companies, but it's not known exactly how much the going rate is for a full data set of this size.

The US Army, Air Force, and Dept. of Veterans Affairs are all listed with a combined 76,379 records.

""Whilst you could piece together parts of the data from information already in the public domain, having it aggregated and so easily searchable in this fashion is enormously valuable,"" said Hunt in an email on Tuesday.

The hack involved 2.2 million email addresses, as well as 287,000 phone numbers, many of which are from kids under the age of 18.The app is operated by the incubator Science, and is one of the more popular social networking applications in the U.S., currently ranking No. 14 in that category on iTunes.Users have been alerted to the hack by way of an email from the company, which explains that it became aware of the breach on March 14, 2017.Per the email, hackers appear to have accessed a private API to pull information on Wishbone users. This included usernames, personal names, emails and phone numbers. Some users also opted to provide their date of birth to Wishbone, and, if they did, this information was also included. Wishbone says no passwords or financial information was part of the breach, however.Users were also alerted via an in-app notification.The message says that Wishbone is initiating “precautionary measures” as a part of the breach. But Motherboard received confirmation that the vulnerability has now been fixed.Unfortunately, the data is already out there in the wild, and consists mainly of kids’ personal information. The app’s core demographic is very young users — many who don’t even yet have iPhones, but play with the app on their iPod touch.

A spokesman for Kadri’s office, who declined to be identified, said the theft might affect patients in at least 17 states and seven countries outside the United States.“Despite having only recently being discovered, the breach, which affects thousands of patients, started shortly after the ... staffer was hired in September of 2016,” the statement read.A Palmdale residence belonging to Kadri was also burglarized May 5, according to a statement issued Thursday by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Patient files, medical supplies and electronic devices were stolen, authorities said. Kadri’s spokesman described the residence as an “administrative office” the surgeon uses when performing procedures in a Palmdale office.“Nobody knows it’s there except for us. It’s our registered address for all business documents,” the spokesman said.Though Kadri said in the statement that he believes the break-in was carried out by the same employee, the Sheriff’s Department said there were no witnesses. Investigators want to question the ex-employee, who has not yet been detained, according to the department statement.Calls to the Palmdale Sheriff’s Station on Friday seeking additional comment were not immediately returned.Kadri’s office also learned recently that an Instagram account was created to host what are believed to be illegal recordings of patients during surgery. The account, which contains videos of procedures and pictures of patients, published its earliest post in January.“These patients did not approve this,” the spokesman said. “We did not approve this.”The employee was hired as a driver for Kadri in September 2016, and over time she began to take on additional duties. She quit in March of this year after Kadri and his staff accused her of embezzling from the company, the spokesman said.""",Media

Gaining access illicitly was relatively easy.The data was highly sensitive, revealing personal details of Facebook users, such as the results of psychological tests. It was meant to be stored and shared anonymously, however such poor precautions were taken that deanonymising would not be hard.. . . .Facebook suspended myPersonality from its platform on 7 April saying the app may have violated its policies due to the language used in the app and on its website to describe how data is shared.More than 6 million people completed the tests on the myPersonality app and nearly half agreed to share data from their Facebook profiles with the project. All of this data was then scooped up and the names removed before it was put on a website to share with other researchers. The terms allow the myPersonality team to use and distribute the data “in an anonymous manner such that the information cannot be traced back to the individual user”.To get access to the full data set people had to register as a collaborator to the project. More than 280 people from nearly 150 institutions did this, including researchers at universities and at companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo.. . . .For the last four years, a working username and password has been available online that could be found from a single web search. Anyone who wanted access to the data set could have found the key to download it in less than a minute.The publicly available username and password were sitting on the code-sharing website GitHub. They had been passed from a university lecturer to some students for a course project on creating a tool for processing Facebook dataThe credentials gave access to the “Big Five” personality scores of 3.1 million users. These scores are used in psychology to assess people’s characteristics, such as conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism. The credentials also allowed access to 22 million status updates from over 150,000 users, alongside details such as age, gender and relationship status from 4.3 million people.. . . .Each user in the data set was given a unique ID, which tied together data such as their age, gender, location, status updates, results on the personality quiz and more. With that much information, de-anonymising the data can be done very easily. “You could re-identify someone online from a status update, gender and date,” says Dixon.",Media
