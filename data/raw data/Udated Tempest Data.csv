Nearby businesses were also targeted by the same perpetrators, who stole laptops from those businesses as well. Nevro has been unable to recover the stolen laptops on which limited information relating to you has been stored.We have no indication that these laptops were stolen in order to acquire the data on them, nor any indication that the data on the laptops has been accessed or used in any way. All the stolen Nevro laptops were password-protected, although not all were encrypted. Because limited information about your treatment relationship with Nevro was stored on one or more of the stolen laptops, and applicable state law considers this type of information sufficient to warrant a notification, we are reaching out to advise you of these equipment thefts.Â  What Information Was Involved? Limited categories of information about certain patients who use Nevroâs HF10 therapy were contained in files stored on one or more of the unencrypted laptops. The categories of information varied by file or patient, but the data fields were limited to patient name, street address, birth date, procedure date, medical device identifiers (such as serial number), and contact information for the patientâs physician or other medical provider.Nevro does not possess, and none of these laptops contained, sensitive identifying information such as Social Security or other government-issued identification numbers or credit card or financial institution information.

Â The switch was turned off and no further health information was sent after the breach was discovered on January 26, 2011.

Acquisitions employee has resulted in the protected health information

In May 2015, Oceans Acquisitions confirmed that all portable devices,
 including laptop computers, had sensitive data encrypted. In the event 
of theft or loss of a device, all PHI stored on that device would be 
protected. The encryption would prevent any unauthorized individual from
 being able to access stored data.
However, the laptop theft occurred on April 9, 2015, a month before 
Oceans Acquisitions ascertained that all devices were protected. While 
the healthcare provider believed the laptop computer theft did not place
 any data at risk of exposure, this has turned out not to be the case.
According to a substitute breach notice issued on February 2, 2016, 
Oceans Acquisitions determined that the laptop in question did contain 
the PHI of 659 individuals, and that those patients potentially had 
their PHI exposed. This came to light during an unrelated systems 
review, which was not linked to the laptop computer theft.
The data were stored in an email account that could be accessed 
through the computer. The data exposed included names of patients, 
medical record numbers, dates of birth, payer information, medical 
diagnoses, and admission dates. No financial information, insurance 
data, or Social Security numbers were stored in the email account or on

2/28/2014,80's Tees,Mt. Pleasant,Pennsylvania,HACK,BSR,3503,"80sTees.com, Inc. announced a data breach that was much larger than originally thought. The online retailer originally reported the breach in April of 2013 to customers whose credit card numbers had been used fraudulently. Since that time, the retailer's investigation uncovered that the scope of the exposure to customer credit card information was larger than originally believed. The company has notified any customer who used the site from June 3, 2012 through April 30, 2013 that their credit card may have been used fraudulently.Â  Originally the company was contacted by Discover Card requesting an investigation due to some unauthorized charges experienced by Discover cards customers. The company completed their own investigation and on February 27, 2013 learned that a small number of Visa customers had also experienced unauthorized charges. On March 6, 2013 Mastercard also contacted the company regarding fraudulent charges against their credit card holders.The company hired a forensic investigator who discovered that the company had been a victim of a cyber attack that gained access to and installed malware on their website server in eary June 2012. Their anitvirus and malware scans did not detect the malware. April 3, 2013 the company notified approximately 3,503 customers of the breach. This is the amount that was reported to the company by the credit card companies.Â  On April 22, 2013, the company received a report from the forensic investigator that 2,598 credit cards were compromised. On April 30, 2013 the company received calls from two customers stating that their cards had been compromised. The company investigated those customers' complaints and reported the issue to the Secret Service. The Secret Service asked the company to not provide any additional notice until their investigation had been completed.The Secret Service investigation uncovered that the hackers had set up an unauthorized email account that captured the company's credit card transactions without their knowledge. The Secret Service could not definitely say who the hacker or hackers were. Based on the information the company received, they believed it to be a former high level employee who has since died.Â Â Â ",California Attorney General,,2012,40.185893,-79.562841,,,

A woman made the discovery about a month ago and gave the documents to investigators with Aetna Insurance Co.

There were eight bags of nothing but Social Security numbers, names, and death benefits. Information also included patient records and medications. Aetna responded by saying, ""Aetna is committed to protecting the privacy of our members and we take this situation seriously. We have policies for properly safeguarding our membersâ information, and we are investigating how this incident occurred, but it appears to be human error. The woman contacted us via e-mail on the evening of May 5, and we immediately responded the next morning. She has consistently declined to give us her name or phone number, or to make arrangements to allow us to retrieve the documents at a place convenient for her, or to return them to us. As of today, we now have the files, and will go through each of them to determine the contents and whether any member information has been breached. If it has been, we will notify those members and take steps to mitigate any potential harm."" The woman attempted to arrange the hand-off, however, a short time after she got off the phone with the company, three men from Aetna showed up at her workplace, unannounced, and asked for the documents immediately. The woman said, ""But when they sent the three guys to my work yesterday, it was an intimidation tactic and I didn't appreciate it. So that told me what I was going to do. That they were going to try and hide it."" Aetna said someone from the company made a ""serious human error,"" and it will now go through the files to make sure no sensitive information was lost. What's more troubling, the woman said, is that the bureau wasn't the only piece of furniture offered for free that day. ""Out of the pieces that were up for grabs, whose to say that I've got the only piece that was full of Aetna papers."" The woman has also contacted the state to investigate the situation.

A joint investigation into the employee had been conducted by the FBI and the Berkeley County Sheriffâs Department.As soon as WVU Medicine University Healthcare became aware of the incident, an internal investigation was launched. Two days later, the employee was suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. Information provided to the healthcare provider from law enforcement linked the employee with 113 former patients who had suffered identity theft.The healthcare worker had been employed by WVU Medicine University Healthcare since March 2004 and was required to schedule appointments for patients at both the Berkeley Medical Center in Martinsburg, WV and Jefferson Medical Center in Ranson, WV. The investigation revealed that the inappropriate accessing of medical records first occurred on March 1, 2016. Inappropriate access continued until the notification was received by law enforcement.No evidence was uncovered to suggest that the employee copied ePHI onto a portable device, although Teresa McCabe, vice president of marketing and development, said the employee manually copied data from computer screens and removed that information from the premises. A link between 113 patients and the employee was found, although in total, 7,445 breach notification letters were sent to patients informing them of unauthorized ePHI access.After the investigation confirmed that hospital and HIPAA Rules had been violated, WVU Medicine University Healthcare terminated the employee. A criminal investigation is ongoing and the woman is being prosecuted.The female employee was found to be in possession of driverâs licenses with photos and insurance and Social Security cards, suggesting the stolen information had already been used for identity theft. It is unclear whether those identification documents have been used to fraudulently obtain credit or medical services.All individuals impacted by the incident have been offered credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for a period of one year via Kroll. Patients have been encouraged to check their accounts, credit histories, and EoB statements and to alert their financial organizations to the possibility of fraudulent use of their information.""More information: http://www.hipaajournal.com/berkeley-medical-center-employee-inappropria...",Media,,2017,37.871899,-122.25854,,,

It also includes the child's device name -- which is often just their name -- and their device's unique identifier. The data contains the plaintext passwords for the child's Apple ID. Because the app requiresÂ that two-factor authentication is turned off, a malicious actor viewing this data only needs to use the credentials to break into the child's account to access their personal content data.None of the records contained content data, such as photos or messages, or the locations of either parents or children.The data also contained error messages associated with a failed account action, such as if a parent looking up a child's real-time location didn't complete.Shortly before the server went offline, there were at least 10,200 records from the past three months containing customers data -- but some are duplicates.TeenSafe claims to have over a million parents using the service.Â Â Â ",Media,https://www.zdnet.com/article/teen-phone-monitoring-app-leaks-thousands-of-users-data/,2018,34.052234,-118.243685,,,

""When I realized there social security numbers and names and phone numbers and prescription information, it dawned on me that 'hey this probably should not be public if it is real data.' So then I started the process of trying to figure out whose it was."" Jefferson Medical said Vickery was an unauthorized individual who shouldn't have had access to that information.""This information is private information,"" said Katie Gilchrist, Jefferson Medical's legal counsel. ""It's federally protected information. It's information that was on our server. This individual accessed it without our permission. He did in secret.

You leave the house, and you leave a window unlocked. These folks out there think that entitles them to come into the house and look around at all your stuff and then take things with them when they leave. That's just not appropriate.""Vickery said this isn't a hack because the information was readily available to anyone who knewwhere to look.""There was nothing to hack,"" Vickery said. ""There simply was no password, no user name, no security features of any sort being used. If you want to use a real analogy, here's a better one. I drove along a country road, a public country road, that not many people drive along, and on the side of the road, there were some records. Jefferson Medical left those records there. I took pictures of them and hunted down Jefferson and told them their records were on the side of the road. There's no crime involved there. That's not hacking.

A spokesman for Kadriâs office, who declined to be identified, said the theft might affect patients in at least 17 states and seven countries outside the United States.âDespite having only recently being discovered, the breach, which affects thousands of patients, started shortly after the ... staffer was hired in September of 2016,â the statement read.A Palmdale residence belonging to Kadri was also burglarized May 5, according to a statement issued Thursday by the Los Angeles County Sheriffâs Department.

Itâs our registered address for all business documents,â the spokesman said.Though Kadri said in the statement that he believes the break-in was carried out by the same employee, the Sheriffâs Department said there were no witnesses.

The account, which contains videos of procedures and pictures of patients, published its earliest post in January.âThese patients did not approve this,â the spokesman said. âWe did not approve this.âThe employee was hired as a driver for Kadri in September 2016, and over time she began to take on additional duties.

Â It was stolen from a rental car parked in the parking lot of a Minneapolis restaurant. Â The laptop was in the possession of an employee of the contractor Accretive. Â It contained the names, addresses, dates of birth, medical information, and Social Security numbers of patients.Â  A total of 14,000 Fairview patients were affected.Â  Approximately 2,800 North Memorial patients were affected, but did not have their Social Security numbers exposed.UPDATEÂ (1/20/2012): A lawsuit was filed against Accretive Health, Inc. as a result of the breach.Â Approximately 23,500 patients in Minnesota were affected by the breach.Â Â The Minnesota Attorney General claims that Accretive failed to protect patient health care records and failed to disclose its extensive involvement in patient health care. Â According to the Minnesota Attorney General, Accretive gained access to sensitive patient data through contracts with the two hospitals and numerically scored patients' risk of hospitalization and medical complexity, graded their ""frailty,"" compiled per-patient profit and loss reports, and identified patients deemed to be ""outliers."" The physical and mental health information included a checklist of 22 different chronic medical conditions that patients did or did not have. Â This was without the knowledge or consent of patients and the Attorney General argues that patients had the right to know how their information was being used and to have it kept confidential.Accretive tells investors that its contracts with hospitals include risk scoring patients, reducing avoidable hospital admissions, identifying the sickest and most impact-able patients for proactive management, and identifying real-time interventions with significant revenue or cost impact. The lawsuit alleges that Accretive violated state and federal health privacy laws, state debt collection laws, and state consumer protection laws. Â It seeks an order requiring Accretive to fully disclose to patients: 1) what information it has about Minnesota patients; 2) what information it has lost about Minnesota patients; 3) where and to whom it has sent information about Minnesota patients; and 4) the purposes for which it amasses and uses information about Minnesota patients. In addition, the lawsuit asks Accretive to disclose whether it has sent health data about Minnesota patients to an offshore site in new Delhi, India and requests that restrictions be applied to how Accretive treats and uses patient data.The press release from the Office of Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson can be found here.UPDATEÂ (08/24/2012): A settlement agreement with Accretive Health was announced at the end of July. Â The settlement requires Accretive to stop doing business in Minnesota for two years and to pay approximately $2.5 million to the State of Minnesota, a portion of which will be used to compensate patients.",Databreaches.net,,2011,37.09024,-95.712891,,,

The file contained sensitive, personally identifiable information of 36,000 of the aircraft manufacturerâs employees.

The spreadsheet also included Social security numbers and dates of birth, albeit in âhidden columns,â according to Olson.Spreadsheet software, such asÂ Microsoftâs Excel, usually allows authors to make select information hidden, usually to prevent that data from being seen, changed, or deleted.According to Olsonâs letter, the breach was discovered earlier this year, on Jan.Â 9, but the company didnât begin to inform employees until a month later, Feb.Â 8.In the letter to Ferguson, Boeing claims it destroyed copies of the spreadsheet and carried out a âforensic examinationâ of both the Boeing employeeâs computer and his spouseâs to ensure it was deleted.""More information: https://threatpost.com/boeing-notifies-36000-employees-following-breach/...",Media,,2017,47.60621,-122.332071,,,

When the campus detected a vulnerability in one of these areas in November, the campus began installing and testing a security fix â known as a patch â which can take weeks, Rivers said during the press call. During this process, attackers were able to discover a security flaw and gained access to the system.BFS contains the information of about 50 percent of current students and 65 percent of active employees. Affected individuals largely include students, faculty and staff who received payments from the campus, mainly through electronic fund transfers. Those who received paper payments, however, may have also been affected.A private computer investigation firm was retained by the campus to further determine whether personal information was compromised. The campus will send notice letters in the mail with more information about free credit monitoring and insurance to those who were potentially impacted starting Friday.According to Rivers, this is the third significant breach UC Berkeley has seen in the past five years.Within a day of the unauthorized intrusion Dec. 28, the campusâs security team had detected and began efforts to contain the attack, according to campus spokesperson Janet Gilmore.Once campus IT staff identified the unauthorized access, they forensically preserved copies of the system for investigation purposes and took affected servers offline for about two weeks to prevent further access. When the campus shut down BFS and supporting systems, some students received emails in early January notifying them of possible disruptions to financial aid disbursements.""More information: http://www.dailycal.org/2016/02/26/campus-notifies-nearly-80000-students...",Media,,2015,37.871593,-122.272747,,,

The incident, which exposed data on almost 80,000 individuals, seems to spotlight a persistent problem facing a growing number of organizations that use misconfigured MongoDB and other similar databases, security exerts say (see Database Hijackings: Who's Next?).In a statement posted on its website, Atlanta, Ga.-based Emory Healthcare says that on Jan. 3, the organization ""learned that there was unauthorized access to [its patient appointment] waits & delays database around the New Year's weekend after someone deleted the database and demanded that EHC pay to have it restored.""In addition to the extortion attack on the database, Emory Healthcare says in its notification statement that it also learned ""that there was another unauthorized access by an independent security research center that searches out vulnerabilities in applications and traditionally notifies the company so that it can be remedied.""The unnamed independent security research firm referenced by Emory in its statement is believed to be MacKeeper Security Research Center. That's because Mackeeper wrote in a Jan. 4 blog that on Dec. 30, its security researchers discovered a misconfigured Mongo database that ""contained hundreds of thousands of what appeared to be patient records and other sensitive information,"" belonging to Emory Healthcare.

Michaels is accused of knowingly violating federal and state law by failing to take reasonable steps to safeguard customers' personal information. Â Michaels is also accused of failing to alert customers as soon as the security breach was discovered.

Gaining access illicitly was relatively easy.The data was highly sensitive, revealing personal details of Facebook users, such as the results of psychological tests. It was meant to be stored and shared anonymously, however such poor precautions were taken that deanonymising would not be hard.. . . .Facebook suspended myPersonality from its platform on 7 April saying the app may have violated its policies due to the language used in the app and on its website to describe how data is shared.More than 6 million people completed the tests on the myPersonality app and nearly half agreed to share data from their Facebook profiles with the project. All of this data was then scooped up and the names removed before it was put on a website to share with other researchers. The terms allow the myPersonality team to use and distribute the data âin an anonymous manner such that the information cannot be traced back to the individual userâ.To get access to the full data set people had to register as a collaborator to the project.

Of those emails sent externally, 20 were sent to six IRS employeesâ personal email accounts. The significance of where the emails were sent is relevant to the level of the security risk to the taxpayer data. The report noted that unencrypted emails sent within the IRS internal network were of lower risk because they remained behind the agencyâs firewalls which greatly lowers the probability they could be accessed by a third party. However, the emails sent outside of the agency were exposed to greater risk, not only because they were not encrypted, but because they no longer had the protection afforded by the firewall. Additionally, for the emails sent to personal accounts, the report noted that per IRS policy, no officer or employee of the IRS may use a personal email account to conduct official business. 326 emails containing 8,031 different taxpayersâ data may not sound like much, but TIGTA had this to say about their findings"" - See more at: http://www.fedsmith.com/2016/11/20/ig-irs-employees-sent-unencrypted-ema...More information: http://www.fedsmith.com/2016/11/20/ig-irs-employees-sent-unencrypted-ema...",Media,,2016,38.907192,-77.036871,,,

Â On April 18, 2011 a court ruled that the loss of information caused injury. The court determined that ""the unauthorized disclosure of personal information via the Internet is itself relatively new, and therefore more likely to raise issues of law not yet settled in the courts."" Â The court also found that RockYou.com's privacy policy language, which stated that RockYou.com's servers were secure, did not automatically preclude the plaintiff's allegation that a contract had been breached because the plaintiff alleged that the servers were not secure.UPDATEÂ (3/27/2012): The Federal Trade Commission is alleging that RockYou violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Rule (COPPA Rule) by collecting information from approximately 179,000 children. Â A proposed FTC settlement order requires RockYou to pay a civil penalty of $250,000 to settle COPPA charges. In addition to the penalty, the company would be barred from future deceptive claims regarding company privacy and data security, required to implement and maintain a data security program, and barred from future violations of the COPPA rule.",Databreaches.net,,2009,37.485215,-122.236355,,,

3/15/2017,Dunn and Bradstreet,New York,New York,DISC,BSO,33500000," 	 	 	 	 	""NEW YORK -- Millions of records from a commercial corporate database have been leaked. 	 	 	 	 	The database, about 52 gigabytes in size, contains just under 33.7 million unique email addresses and other contact information from employees of thousands of companies, representing a large portion of the US corporate population. 	 	 	 	 	Dun & Bradstreet, a business services giant, confirmed that it owns the database, which it acquired as part  	of a 2015 deal to buy NetProspex for $125 million.The purchased database contains dozens of fields, some including personal information such as names, job titles and functions, work email addresses, and phone numbers. 	 	 	 	 	Other information includes more generic corporate and publicly sourced data, such as believed office location, the number of employees in the business unit, and other descriptions of the kind of industry the company falls into, such as advertising, legal,  media and broadcasting, and telecoms. 	 	 	 	 	This entire database is used for marketers who want to directly target their own email campaigns and through other communications methods for current and prospective customers. 	 	 	 	 	The data can be bought either in bulk, or by type of record by companies, but it's not known exactly how much the going rate is for a full data set of this size. We understand from  	a 2015 brochure that the cost of accessing a half-million records can cost some firms up to $200,000. 	 	 	 	 	Troy Hunt, who runs breach notification site  	Have I Been Pwned, obtained the database and analyzed the records. 	 	 	 	 	In  	a blog post Tuesday, Hunt said the breakdown was entirely US-focused, with California as the most represented demographic with over four million records, then New York with 2.7 million records and Texas with 2.6 million records. 	 	 	 	 	Hunt's analysis of the records showed that the leading organization by records is the Dept. of Defense, with 101,013 employee records, followed closely by the US Postal Service with 88,153 employee records. 	 	 	 	 	The US Army, Air Force, and Dept. of Veterans Affairs are all listed with a combined 76,379 records. 	 	 	 	 	AT&T, Boeing, Dell, FedEx, IBM, and Xerox were among the most named companies in the database, with tens of thousands of employee records each. 	 	 	 	 	""Whilst you could piece together parts of the data from information already in the public domain, having it aggregated and so easily searchable in this fashion is enormously valuable,"" said Hunt in an email on Tuesday. ""It also serves as a reminder that we've lost control of our privacy; the vast majority of people in the data set would have no idea their information is being sold in this fashion and they certainly don't have any control over it."" 	 	 	 	 	Hunt ran the exposed database through  	Have I Been Pwned's database of breached records, which showed 14 percent of email addresses already existed in his database. 	 	 	 	 	The data is now searchable in  	Have I Been Pwned. 	 	 	 	 	But it's not known exactly how the data was exposed, or who is to blame for the leak.Â  	 	 	 	 	A spokesperson for Dun & Bradshaw would not talk on the record beyond an emailed statement, sent prior to publication. 	 	 	 	 	""We've carefully evaluated the information that was shared with us and it is of a type and in a format that we deliver to customers every day.

Security researcher and Haveibeenpwned
 owner Troy Hunt recently found a database containing the stolen account
 information for sale on a dark web market site and listed the breach on
 his own site as the third largest ever.
A hacker known as Peace was selling the database for $150, according to Vice's Motherboard.
 Peace told Motherboard the price is so low because the salted passwords
 are very difficult to crack however, Hunt told the publication roughly 
half of the passwords will likely be cracked due to weak password 
protections that were used at the time. 
On May 12, Tumblr notified
 users of the breach that compromised user email addresses with salted 
and hashed passwords from early 2013 and told users there is no reason 
to believe that the information was used to access their Tumblr 
accounts.
Although the breach isn't as bad as other major breaches, it has the 
potential to be dangerous for users who re-use passwords, Kaspersky Lab 
Senior Security Researcher Brian Bartholomew told SCMagazine.com via 
email. 
âIf you were to think about how many users from Tumblr have Apple 
cloud accounts, Twitter accounts, Gmail or other online mail accounts, 
etc. the potential risk is high for this breach to bleed over into other
 stories down the road,â he said.Â  âThese credentials could be used by 
criminals to access anything from bank accounts, to mail accounts, to 
other online systems that may house personal data / pictures / etc.â
Bartholomew also said the credentials could be used to carry out phishing attacks, targeting and extortion.""More information: https://www.scmagazine.com/tumblr-accounts-from-2013-breach-for-sale-on-...",Media,,2016,40.712784,-74.005941,,,

It discovered the intrusion mid-December 2006. Transaction data from 2003 as well as mid-May through December 2006 may have been accessed. According to its Web site, TJX is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide.Note on our total: included in this breach are 45,700,000 credit and debit card account numbers; 455,000 merchandise return records containing customer names and driver's license numbers; recovery of about 200,000 stolen credit card account numbers; records then 1indicated an additional 48 million people have been affected. Totals were estimated at 94 million but now seem to have affected over 100 million accounts.UPDATEÂ  (2/22/2007):TJX said that while it first thought the intrusion took place from May 2006 to January 2007, it now thinks its computer system was also hacked in July 2005 and on various subsequent dates that year.UPDATE (3/21/2007): Information stolen from TJX's systems was being used fraudulently in November 2006 in an $8 million gift card scheme, one month before TJX officials said they learned of the breach, according to Florida law enforcement officials.

UPDATE (04/26/2007): Three states' banking associations (MA, CT, and ME) filed a class action lawsuit against TJX to recover the costs of damages totaling tens of millions of dollars incurred for replacing customers' debit and credit cards. UPDATE (05/04/2007): An article in the WSJ notes that because TJX had an outdated wireless security encryption system, had failed to install firewalls and data encryption on computers using the wireless network, and had not properly install another layer of security software it had bought, thieves were able to access data streaming between hand-held price-checking devices, cash registers and the store's computers. 21 U.S. and Canadian lawsuits seek damages from the retailer for reissuing compromised cards.

UPDATE (2/10/2008): Notices are going out to millions of customers who may have had credit card information compromised in a data breach. The notices contain information about eligibility for compensation such as vouchers and credit monitoring to be provided under a proposed settlement. UPDATE (4/2/2008): TJX Cos. reached a settlement with MasterCard Inc. in which it will pay up to $24 million to banks and other institutions to cover fraud losses stemming from a massive data breach disclosed last year. They also struck a similar deal with rival card network Visa in which it agreed to pay up to $40.9 million.

UPDATE (8/5/2008): Eleven perpetrators allegedly involved in the hacking of nine major U.S. retailers have been charged with numerous crimes, including conspiracy, computer intrusion, fraud and identity theft. This is the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. An indictment was returned on Aug. 5, 2008. Conspirators obtained the credit and debit card numbers by wardriving and hacking into the wireless computer networks of major retailers -- including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW. The indictments are the result of a three-year undercover investigation conducted out of the San Diego Field Office of the U.S. Secret Service. UPDATE (8/30/2008): TrustCo BankCorp NY sued TJX in August 2008 to recoup costs it incurred from reissuing an estimated 4,000 customer MasterCard debit cards after hackers accessed the TJX computer network. The bank stated its cost for the breach was up to $20 per affected account, explaining that it suffered losses from administrative expenses and lost interest and transaction fees. Later in the month, TJX in turn claimed that Trustco failed to implement policies or procedures that would have enabled the bank to avoid canceling and replacing customer debit cards. UPDATE (9/22/2008):One of the 11 people arrested last month in connection with the massive data theft at T JX Companies Inc., BJ Wholesale Clubs Inc. and several other retailers pleaded guilty yesterday to four felony counts, including wire and credit card fraud and aggravated identity theft. Many of the Internet attacks that he facilitated were SQL injection attacks, according to court documents. The stolen data was sold to cyber criminals in Eastern Europe and the U.S. or used to make fraudulent credit and debit cards. UPDATE (6/26/2009): TJX has agreed to pay $9.75 million to 41 states and to implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program, designed to safeguard consumer data and address any weaknesses in TJX's systems in place at the time of the breach. Of the $9.75 million monetary payment under the settlement, $5.5 million is to be dedicated to data protection and consumer protection efforts by the states, and $1.75 million is to reimburse the costs and fees of the investigation. Further, $2.5 million of the settlement will fund a Data Security Trust Fund to be used by the state Attorneys General to advance enforcement efforts and policy development in the field of data security and protecting consumersâ personal information.

The money primarily will be used to cover the banks' expenses in pursuing the legal action.UPDATE (12/15/2009):A Miami hacker who had already pleaded guilty to computer fraud and identity theft for breaches at retailers T.J. Maxx, OfficeMax, and many other merchants, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to similar charges related to breaches at Heartland Payment Systems, 7-11, Hannaford Brothers supermarkets, and two other companies. Albert Gonzalez, 28, reiterated terms of a plea agreement in U.S. District Court in Boston. A week earlier, co-conspirator Stephen Watt of New York, appeared in that same court and was ordered to serve two years in prison and pay $171.5 million in restitution for developing a sniffing program used to grab payment card data in the breach at the TJX companies between 2003 and 2008. UPDATE (3/17/2010): Humza Zaman, a co-conspirator in the hack of TJX and other companies, was sentenced in Boston to 46 months in prison and fined $75,000 for his role in the conspiracy. The sentence matches what prosecutors were seeking. Zaman was charged with laundering between $600,000 and $800,000 for hacker Albert Gonzalez, who is currently awaiting sentencing on charges that he and others hacked into TJX, Office Max, Heartland Payment Systems and numerous other companies to steal data on more than 100 million credit and debit card accounts. Zaman pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy. His sentence includes three years of supervised release with the condition that Zaman must disclose his conviction to any future employer. Upon release, Zaman will not be barred from using computers. Zaman is the second conspirator in the TJX case to be charged. Former Morgan Stanley coder, Stephen Watt, was sentenced in December to two years in prison for his role in the TJX case, which involved supplying Gonzalez with a sniffer program used to siphon card data from the TJX network.Â UPDATEÂ (3/29/2010): A 28-year-old college dropout who became the worldâs biggest credit card hacker on Thursday was sentenced to 20 years in prison for stealing millions of credit union and bank account records from TJX Cos., BJâs Wholesale Club, Office Max, Dave & Busters, Barnes & Noble and a string of other companies â even as he was working as a $75,000-a-year undercover informant for the U.S. government in identity theft cases. But thatâs not the end of it, as Albert Gonzalez is scheduled to be sentenced again to additional years behind bars for additional data thefts at Heartland Payment Systems, Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and 7-Eleven convenience stores. The theft of credit card data cost financial institutions, insurers and cardholders an estimated $200 million, according to law enforcement. JC Penney and Wet Seal were both officially added to the list of retail victims of Albert Gonzalez on Friday (March 26) when U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock refused to continue their cloak of secrecy and removed the seal from their names. StorefrontBacktalk had reported last August that $17 billion JC Penney chain was one of Gonzalez.s victims, even though JC Penney's media representatives were denying it. But the $561 million chain Wet Seal, which has 504 stores in 47 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, had kept their identity secret. No more and that.s the way Woodlock wanted it.Â UPDATEÂ (4/16/2010): Damon Patrick Toey, the 'trusted subordinate' of TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced in Boston to 5 more years in prison. He also received a $100,000 fine and three years. supervised release, according to the Justice Department.UPDATE (7/8/2010): TJX has settled another lawsuit.Â  The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, a shareholder of TJX stock, settled with TJX for $595,000 in legal fees and enhanced oversight of customer files.UPDATE (4/8/2011):Â Albert Gonzalez is appealing his conviction for his role in a
large data breach by claiming that his actions were authorized by the Secret
Service. Â The government acknowledged that Gonzalez was a key undercover Secret Service informant at the time of the breaches.

Sony placed an outage to block users from playing online games or accessing services like Netflix and Hulu Plus on Friday April 22. Sony says the outage will continue until the situation is addressed, which will likely be within the next week. Sony believes an unauthorized person has obtained names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, PlayStation Network/Qriocity password and login, and handle/PSN online IDs for multiple users. The attacker may have also stolen users' purchase history, billing address, and password security questions. User credit card numbers may have also been obtained. Sony has hired a security firm to investigate the incident and strengthen the network infrastructure by re-building their system to provide greater protection of personal information.An individual filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all PSN users following seven days of a Sony PlayStation Network outage.

Additionally, the CEO issued an apology letter.UPDATEÂ (5/17/2011): Hackers began changing user passwords by using PSN account emails and dates of birth within two days of the partial restoration of the PlayStation Network. Â Sony failed to alter the password reset system to account for hackers having obtained user email addresses and dates of birth. Â Users who changed their passwords, but not the email associated with their PlayStation Network accounts, were vulnerable to the hacker exploit. Sony shut down the PlayStation Network again and released a short statement about the incident.UPDATEÂ (5/23/2011): Sony headquarters expects to spend about $171 million on its personal information theft protection program, welcome back programs, customer support, network security enhancements and legal costs associated with the breach.UPDATEÂ (6/2/2011): Sony fully restored all Playstation Network services in all areas except Japan.

5/17/2016,LinkedIn,Mountain View,California,HACK,BSO,117000000,"""A recent incident involving LinkedIn, the business-oriented social 
networking service, is showing that data breaches can cause big problems
 for companies and consumers â even years after the breaches take place.
 On May 17, 2016, LinkedIn discovered that information stolen in a 2012 
incident was being made available online, and notified site users immediately the next day about what happened and what they were doing to fix it.
In 2012, an alleged 117 million
 email and password combinations were stolen by hackers. At the time, 
LinkedIn issued a mandatory password reset for any accounts they thought
 were compromised; all LinkedIn members were encouraged to change their 
passwords as well, just in case.
Fast forward to present day, and the 2012 breach has come back to 
haunt LinkedIn. The stolen data popped up online, and in an e-mail to 
LinkedIn users sent on May 25, 2016, the company said the published 
information included email addresses, hashed passwords, and LinkedIn 
member IDs, which are an internal identifier LinkedIn assigns to each 
member profile. They immediately invalidated passwords of all LinkedIn 
accounts that were created prior to the 2012 breach and had not 
undergone a password reset since the breach.
LinkedInâs attempts to protect users, however, are extending beyond 
resetting passwords this time. They are also using automated tools to 
try and identify (and block) any suspicious activity on specific 
LinkedIn accounts. The proper authorities have been contacted and 
LinkedIn is working with law enforcement. They have demanded that anyone
 making stolen password data available must stop immediately, or face 
potential legal action.
In their e-mail, the company also shared that they have improved 
security features since the 2012 breach, which will hopefully prevent 
another incident like this from happening in the future. As examples, 
they noted that they use salted hashes to store passwords and offer two-step verification
 for members who are interested in additional security. LinkedIn also 
encouraged members to use strong passwords and to change them regularly.
 If you donât change your password often enough because you have trouble
 remembering new passwords, consider using a password manager, which can help youÂ keep all of your passwords organized.""More information: https://www.identityforce.com/blog/linkedin-data-breach-continues-cause-...",Media,,2016,37.386052,-122.083851,,,

1/20/2009,Heartland Payment Systems,Princeton,New Jersey,HACK,BSF,130000000,"After being alerted by Visa and MasterCard of suspicious activity surrounding processed card transactions, the company last week found evidence of malicious software that compromised card data that crossed Heartland's network. This incident may be the result of a global cyberfraud operation. UPDATE (01/26/2009): Heartland Payment Systems has been sued. The lawsuit seeks damages and relief for the inexplicable delay, questionable timing, and inaccuracies concerning the disclosures with regard to the data breach, which is believed to be the largest in U.S. history. UPDATEÂ (02/12/2009): According to BankInfoSecurity.com, the number of financial institutions that have come forward to say they have been contacted by their credit card companies Visa and MasterCard in relation to the breach has jumped from fewer than 50 to more than 200. UPDATE (06/04/2009): While it's hard to get a handle on just how many consumers were affected by the Heartland Payment Systems (HPY) data breach, the total number of institutions now reporting card compromises is at 656. UPDATE (06/16/2009): Heartland lawsuits to be heard in Texas. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in Louisville, KY issued its decision to consolidate the class action suits. The lawsuits will be heard in the Southern District Court of Texas in Houston. Thirty-one separate lawsuits, on behalf of consumers, investors, banks and credit unions, have been filed against Princeton,N.J.-based Heartland. UPDATE (07/06/2009): Heartland Payment Systems successfully completed the first phase of an end-to-end encryption pilot project designed to enhance its security. UPDATE (08/20/2009): Albert Segvec Gonzalez has been indicted by a federal grand jury in New Jersey - along with two unnamed Russian conspirators - on charges of hacking into Heartland Payment Systems, the New Jersey-based card processing company, as well as Hannaford Brothers, 7-Eleven and two unnamed national retailers, according to the indictment unsealed Monday. Gonzalez, a former Secret Service informant, is already awaiting trial over his involvement in the TJX hack.Total records breached: 100 million transactions per month. It is unclear how many account numbers have been compromised, and how many are represented by multiple transactions. The number of records breached is an estimate, subject to revision. UPDATE (08/20/2009): According to the court document, hackers stole more than 130 million credit and debit card numbers from Heartland and Hannaford combined.UPDATE (05/12/2010): The costs to Heartland Payment Systems Inc. from the massive data breach that it disclosed in January 2009 appear to be steadily adding up. Quarterly financial results released by Heartland last week show that the card payment processor has accrued $139.4 million in breach-related expenses. The figure includes a settlement totaling nearly $60 million with Visa, another of about $3.5 million with American Express and more than $26 million in legal fees. That total also includes $42.8 million that Heartland has set aside to fund proposed settlements with several other litigants over the breach. One example of what the fund is set up for is Heartland's offer to settle several consumer class action lawsuits against it for four million. So far, Heartland has recovered about $30 million from insurance companies.UPDATE (06/02/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has made a third settlement deal, this time with MasterCard, related to a massive data breach two years ago at the card payments processor. As part of the deal, Heartland has agreed to pay as much as US$41.1 million to MasterCard issuers that lost money as a result of the data breach. The deal is contingent on financial institutions representing 80 percent of the affected MasterCard accounts accepting the offer by June 25. MasterCard is recommending that issuers accept the offer.UPDATE (09/01/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has agreed to settle with Discover for five million dollars.Â  Discover will use the money to cover costs of fraud incidents and reissuing cards.UPDATE (09/19/2010): Jerome Abaquin Gonzales is expected to surrender to police and serve jail time for participating in a credit card forgery ring which used information from the Heartland breach.Â  The information came from the 4.2 million Discover credit card customers who used their cards at Hannaford Brothers.UPDATE (09/22/2010): Thomas Michio Taniguchi was sentenced to prison for his role in the forgery ring in which Jerome Abaquin Gonzales also participated.UPDATE (12/07/2011): Heartland legal representatives were able to successfully argue that most of the claims against Heartland that were filed by nine banks should be dismissed. All but one claim was dismissed.UPDATEÂ (02/12/2012): The nine banks may have had their claims against Heartland dismissed because Heartland reported that sharing a contractual relationship with the banks defeats their appeal. However, the credit-card-issuing banks are arguing that a New Jersey economic loss rule only bars claims for foreseeable economic losses when the parties are in a contractual relationship and does not bar their negligence claim against Heartland.UPDATEÂ (07/25/2013): Five more foreign hackers were charged for their role in stealing information from Heartland Payment Systems, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, JetBlue, and J.C.

""They weren't taking security seriously and that's now very clear. I would have trouble trusting Yahoo going forward.""Yahoo was tentative in its description of new problems, saying the incident was ""likely"" distinct from the one it reported in September and that stolen information ""may have included"" names, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.""More information: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-cyber-idUSKBN1432WZYahoo statement: https//yahoo.com/security-updateUPDATE (2/15/2017):""Yahoo's newly issued warning to users about malicious hacks is related to a third data breach that the company disclosed in December 2016.A warning sent to some Yahoo users Wednesday read: ""Based on the ongoing investigation, we believe a forged cookie may have been used in 2015 or 2016 to access your account.""This breach was previously revealed in a December 2016 statement from Yahoo that also provided information on a separate hack that occurred in August 2013 involving more than 1 billion accounts. In addition, some of the 2015 and 2016 incidents have been tied to a ""state-sponsored actor"" that was involved in a different 2014 breach that affected up to 500 million accounts.""Forged cookies"" are digital keys that allow access to information without re-entering passwords.
